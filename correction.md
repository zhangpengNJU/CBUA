# Correction of Figure 2 in CBUA
This correction is to correct a clerical error in "CBUA: A probabilistic, predictive, and practical approach for evaluating test suite effectiveness".
In Figure 2 on page 6, the "Survival Probability(prob)" is not "1 0.476 0.226 0.108 0.051 0.024 ... 0" on the third line, which should be "1 0.476 0.308 0.226 0.178 0.146 ... 0.010" instead.
This clerical error does not affect the rest part of the paper
